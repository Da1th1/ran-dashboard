Accessing the communal areas at ground level and stairwells / lifts to access the roof was only possible. It has not been possible to confirm the building's structural layout. Record drawings / intrusive surveys will be required. It is considered unlikely that access will be granted to the flats as the tenants have expressed anti-telecom views.

The building is listed 

Free-standing antenna and cabinet frames have been proposed, these will be subject to confirmation of the structure of the building.

There appear to be service heads in each of the stairwell landings for the building, it is assumed that a power supply can be taken from these.","F","F","26/01/2025-VG-Survey and PANS, received. Available on SharePoint.

21/02/25 - RP - Craig looped in with Trust email. I will not pursue the Trust survey until we have heard back from you with a progress report/update on the INS front. New quote and scope amended to fit on site requirements. Internal access only. Internal observations grillage connections where access allows as discussed within school building (suspended ceiling). Asbestos survey not available.
20/02/25 - RP - Craig to send this back to INS to gather this information urgently, if we cant , we need to pay a structural survey at KTL cost. Call arranged with Trust tomorrow to clarify Lukasz points.
13/02/25 - RP - Asked Trust for quote on struct survey. Cost plus, so will need to provide CS with approval request showing +12.5%. Roof is non accessible so will need MEWP, have advised trust of this. Scope of survey also sent across to them. Dep clear FC pushed out.

Advised to follow their report recommendation and gather original DD/AB dwgs used for grillage build + survey if the fixings are though bolted as this is the only potential way to make it work. Once this is collected he advises it is passed to B&W since they already completed calcs for the grillage before. Likely a strengthening design needed. No further action until elec survey completed.

06.02.25 - DP - Structural Calculations PASS. Everything is through bolted so no real issues. There's an existing supporting steel column on one of the sectors, but the pole is mostly supported by the masonry wall as there's through bolts and plates on both sides. It would've been better if on the internal side the SHS with plate were fixed straight onto the column instead of the wall. Also, column could've been flush against the wall for better support but this steelwork is existing. Loadings are fine and can't see any major cracking or masonry issues from the photos. At build, I would just advise that the masonry and steelwork are inspected for any defects when removing and installing kit. Also, poles are climbable so should be climbed and any large deflections; vibrations etc. should be flagged at build stage. 
04/02/25 - RP - Struct review required. Do we have all the info we require to proceed with build? All looks to be OK but just needs revieiwng. With Dharmesh and FC for tomorrow.

20.01.25 - DH - electrical survey uploaded to sharepoint please complete electrical design. FC for the 30th.
16/01/25 - RP - Chased DH for update if survey went ahead? Do we have the report ready? Did the surveyor collate the structural info also? Dave chased the surveyor.
06/12/24 - RP - Elec surveyor will need to obtain information regarding pole mounted steelwork. Need to check if backplated and need dims of fixtures. Need resurvey to capture the internal wall mounted poles steelwork to see if done as per previous DD. Also some mortar voids (identified from photos) between bricks close to the wall brackets so would be advised to resurvey having that in mind and receive some survey report on the wall condition, probably mortar repointing will be good enough assuming all brackets are througbolted. Once info collected then can proceed with calcs.

20/02/25 - RP - Chased DM multiple times for PO to be approved and released etc. Task on hold until then.
07/02/25 - RP - Dep FC pushed out to 25th as SPD FC scan report over to us by 21/02.
07/02/25 - RP - Survey complete but report is FC 21/02. I have queried why such a long lead time? They got access to the topside and top floor of the property, scans were undertaken and being reviewed by our structural team now. It is assumed that the stubs are bolted through to the beams. Sketches also attached.
05/02/25 - RP - Chased SPD for survey info, if all went smoothly?Chased DM if approval for this abrupt £750 supervised access for the survey chased and gathered? Can i raise the PO now and request Vicki to send out?
I will have to go back to CS and request approval for this additional £750, but i require some 'internal backing' first, so CS can see we made an educated and well thought decision.

20/02/25 - RP - Liaised with BW and we don't think a calc re run is required as long as we install the PFC overplate. Quried Neo if the secondary bracing pole needs the overplates as well because that cable tray is going to stop us from installing them?
20/02/25 - RP - Structural Calculations CONDITIONAL PASS. Neo to potentially UP REV their calcs to ensure the flat plate is included instead and signed off with new pull out loads. 
18/02/25 - RP - Struct calcs receieved. CONDITIONAL, review required.
11/02/25 - RP - Struct calcs quote recieved. REQ requested, Neo instructed.
11/02/25 - Instructed calcs to Neo, intergrated costs. Luk confirmed calcs OK to proceed with. We still don’t have a proof if there were internal plates and throughbolts installed instead, but I would assume the design was followed and it is just resin anchored. We can base the calcs on that attached previous design. Resin anchors are the worst-case design anyway so will be on the safe side in terms of calcs. Based on the results we might need to redesign to throughbolts, or propose additional overplating of Existing brackets.
10/02/25 - RP - Dep clear pushed out. Luk was on ALso awaiting review of resin anchors / through bolts.
05/02/25 - RP - Requested Resin anchor confirmation from CS.
05/02/25 - RP - Might need a structural survey to confirm if poles are resin anchored. This information was meant to be captured with elec survey but has been missed on the report. Legacy design shows resin anchors but also different from what's on site. If we can't find legacy detail survey required.
05/02/25 - RP - Elec survey finally receieved. Calcs required to be instructed.
28/01/25 - RP - David massey requested i collate all pending Elec survey info sites from DH and escalate them via email to DM, CC and CB.
27/01/25 - RP - Chased DH for updates on survey sites. Has been MIA since Friday 24th.
22/01/25 - RP - Chased DH if the survey info been uploaded? If so, could he please instruct the electrical calcs if all is correct from survey?
22/01/25 - RP - Chased DH if the survey info been uploaded? If so, could he please instruct the electrical calcs if all is correct from survey?
17/01/25 - RP - Elec survey chased to DH for a F/C. Struct info to be obtained at elec visit also. DH has asked for survey doc to be uploaded.
06/01/24 - RP - Revisit approved by CS but please make sure that someone will be there to meet the electrician and that they know where the supply is located and has keys etc. We need to make sure we get the info required on this visit.

24/09/2024-VG- Drone survey confirmed as completed, waiting photos. Scan not completed because went run out of time: For this rooftop the Matterport Scans just take too much time to complete; on 87071 one of the sectors was approximately 45m away from the other antennas meaning we would’ve had to perform 20+ scans in different locations to map across to the other side of the roof which would take around 45minutes minimum so we decided to not do those scans. On top of this the antennas for this sector were wall mounted on an inaccessible external wall so the scans would have only shown the RRU’s. We’ve been told we must be off site by 5.30pm (which leaves us with and hour and a half to get up to the roof and complete all works).

25/02/25 LS: Email sent to NH and SK with information requirements. 4385vf - We have completed a TH on the site, however structural has confirm this won't be suitable due to a large slope in close proximity to the site. (this wasn't that clear from the drone due to tree/vegetation growth, I spotted it looking at legacy photos) We were supposed to do a BDC on the existing base but didn't. Structural said the existing base is unlikely to work anyway and suggested a new base 3x3x1m which there is not enough space in the compound for. His suggestion is to rip the old pole and base out and replace with new, there is still a bit of an issue around how safely the new base could be installed due to the proximity to the slope 
11/02/25 - RP - I managed to get CS to approve only TH and disregard BDC requirement. Supplier quote is now within acceptable means.

Structure          Fail        The structure fails in its HD bolts. Depending on the resolution of the deflection fail, we would recommend a strengthening assessment, this may involve finger beams.
Deflection         Fail        The structure fails in deflection, which it cannot be strengthened against. This will require a load case reduction, concession, or a structure swap.
Foundation       Fail        The foundation fails in overturning and bearing. Please see note 5.

10/12/2024 - RVB - Upon a thorough review we have concluded that the height of the tower is 17.5m + the height of headframe not 20m + height of headframe as shown in the GA’s. I reckon the incorrect height has been perpetuated from older GA’s / DD’s and never corrected.

Please note that the GDC has been completed accordingly with all the antenna heights adjusted to reflect the real situation on site.","3A","T","20/12/2024","26/02/2025","20/12/2024","Martin McWaters","25/02/2025","25/02/2025",""

04/03/25 - RP - Elec added to Leons workpot for  yday and elec has passed.
25/02/25 - RP - KS to instruct the DD. GDC to be completed by Avison Young.
19/02/25 - RP - Going to need to get some base details for this one. CS haven't been able to provide us with anything. Possible piled base.
30/01/25 - RP - This site definitely requires a GDC L3 (structural analysis / GDC + climb survey) as we don’t have any info regarding the structure. But before commencing a mapping survey there are several steps to be undertaken:
- A condition report of the tower structure (members and connections) is to be completed and supplied out by a specialised contractor.
- The unique structure design (eiffelized upper section without diagonals) needs specialized analysis that goes beyond L1 scope. This can be completed in a FEA software based on Eurocode guidelines. It would take some time and will be more costly than a regular GDC.
- The foundation needs confirmation prior to commencing any GDC / tower analysis. Otherwise the structural analysis would be incomplete without the substructure and the results may be rejected. We agree that only the original design documentation can confirm the foundation type.
29/01/25 - RP - Legacy info not viable, L2 required. Cost approval receieved from CS, just awaiting Neo quote. Luk suggetsed we need:
- Detailed site investigation of corrosion extent
- Foundation investigation and original documentation review
- Specialized structural analysis considering the unique tower configuration
28/01/25 - RP - Leanne sourced some legacy info and we have relayed to Neo to reavaluate their stance on the GDC possibility. Awaiting their response.
28/01/25 - RP - Have held off instructing the L2, as i was hoping we would have some legacy info by now. Neo has stated, the proposed upgrade will result in load neutral or even in a slight load reduction so they could use this for a L1 but only if an older L2/L3 GDC is available. The foundation looks to be triangular and could be piles so they would need its original design to complete a L3 GDC. At this moment they are not able to proceed without additional info and an L3 cannot be completed without addressing the rust issue first and gaining the foundation details. We cannot proceed with the L2 without the legacy info.
24/01/25 - RP - Leanne chased Paul for legacy info.
21/01/25 - RP - Chased GDC Return at CS (Matt) for a response.
17/01/25 - RP - Chased GDC Return at CS (Matt) for a response.

18/11/24 - RP - Neo cannot complete GDC L2 without legacy info. Foundation looks to be triangular and could be piles so they would need its original design to complete a L3 GDC. Significant rust issue needs rectifying first also.

Andrew Brammal comments: -  - Agreement expired. Comments from Dom Needham:This won’t impact the upgrade or renewal. I would however, highlight that we had structural issues with this site so we had to design a load neutral scheme in order to get this approved. So you may end up with design issues trying to add RRU / ERS.

There is a inflight design, so site may need elec survey arguably once its complete, for us to proceed with elec calcs. Is there any way around this? We don't have the cabinet info yet, and I don't think we have been given the VODs either so we are not going to know what to design for. Unless CS/VF want the this done to the max config. Probably could have done with a meeting to review this with them.
